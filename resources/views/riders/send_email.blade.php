I hope you're doing well.
We need to address some important issues regarding your attendance and performance in {{date('M Y')}}. We've noticed that you have been absent several times without prior notice. Additionally, your performance as a bike rider has not met the companyâ€™s standards. Specifically, you have been late logging in, and your on-time delivery rate has been below expectations.

As per company guidelines, we expect 26 perfect attendance days and at least 90% on-time delivery. Unfortunately, these targets were not met.
This is a formal warning. If your attendance and performance do not improve immediately, we may need to take further action, including ending your employment According to UAE labor law.
If there are any challenges affecting your work, please speak with your Fleet Supervisor or HR. We are here to support you.
